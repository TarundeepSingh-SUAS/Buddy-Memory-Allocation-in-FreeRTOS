The focus of this paper is in the following questions:

a. What is the most suitable memory allocator design in FreeRTOS?
b. What type of Buddy memory allocation algorithm is suited for FreeRTOS?
c. How does Buddy memory allocation compare to the performance of existing dynamic memory allocation strategies?
d. How to design Buddy Memory Allocator which implements malloc(), calloc, realloc, and free() functions?

The above questions helps in formulating this project's problem statement. This problem statement addresses one or all of the questions mentioned above:
"To design and develop a Buddy Memory Allocator for FreeRTOS, be predictable in timing, have less fragmentation, and efficiently uses limited embedded memory without affecting current applications."
