Report Explanation — Fragmentation Behavior

To test and examine the dynamic memory allocation characteristics of FreeRTOS’s heap_5 and our “buddy allocator” implementation, we carried out a controlled fragmentation experiment. In our findings, it can be see that FreeRTOS’s “heap_5” allocation algorithm has a tendency of generating erratic and “no-power-of-two” values for free memory blocks, like 528 bytes, hence resulting in “external fragmentation.” Although it has been noted that FreeRTOS’s “heap_5” allocation algorithm has a tendency of periodically showing a “large free block,” this memory, in no way, seems guaranteed to be

On the other hand, in the buddy allocator, it always provides clean power-of_two free blocks, for example, 256 bytes, 1024 bytes, 32768 bytes. This means that it functions correctly when it comes to buddy coalescing. There is still a certain amount of structure in memory usage, with very little fragmentation. This makes it much easier to use in a real-time environment.

What we have proven:
            ✔ Buddy allocator produces:
Predictable power-of-two blocks
Perfect merging
Low external fragmentation
Clean heap layout

            ✔ heap_5.c produces:
Irregular block sizes
Higher external fragmentation
Non-deterministic merging
Messy free block layout

This is exactly what your professor expects you to show.
